# Sale-Price-Prediction-Model
I built a multiple linear regression model to predict sale price using various predictors, including Lot Size. I analyzed the significance of each variable, assessed model fit, and calculated the root mean square error (RMSE) to evaluate prediction accuracy, providing insights into factors influencing sale price.
